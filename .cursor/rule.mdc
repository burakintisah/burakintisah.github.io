# Cursor Rules for Burak's Portfolio Website

## Project Overview
This is a modern React TypeScript portfolio website for a backend engineer, built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. The site showcases professional experience, projects, blog posts, and photography with full dark mode support.

**Live Site**: https://burakintisah.com (Deployed on GitHub Pages)  
**Tech Stack**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Firebase  
**Domain**: Custom domain with CNAME (burakintisah.com)

## Tech Stack & Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite (optimized with manual chunks)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Routing**: React Router DOM (SPA with 404.html for GitHub Pages)
- **Icons**: Lucide React (ONLY - no other icon libraries)
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Backend**: Firebase Firestore (analytics), Firebase Auth
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages with gh-pages package
- **Deployment**: Manual via `npm run deploy` (no CI/CD yet)

## Design Philosophy
- **Beautiful, not cookie cutter**: Every design should be unique, modern, and production-ready
- **Professional portfolio aesthetic**: Clean, minimal, focused on content
- **Dark mode first**: All components must support both light and dark modes
- **Mobile responsive**: Mobile-first approach with responsive design
- **Performance focused**: Optimized animations and lazy loading

## File Structure Rules

### Components (`src/components/`)
- **Layout.tsx**: Main layout with navigation, dark mode toggle, social links
- **Button.tsx**: Reusable button component with variants (primary, secondary, outline)
- **AnimatedSection.tsx**: Wrapper for Framer Motion animations
- Keep components small, focused, and reusable
- Each component should handle its own dark mode styling

### Pages (`src/pages/`)
- **Home.tsx**: Landing page with hero section and previews
- **About.tsx**: Personal background, skills, technical toolkit
- **Experience.tsx**: Timeline-based work experience
- **Projects.tsx**: Project showcase with cards
- **Blog.tsx**: Blog posts with sidebar and categories
- **Photography.tsx**: Photo gallery with lightbox
- **RSS.tsx**: RSS feed display and subscription
- Each page should be self-contained with proper TypeScript interfaces

### Styling Guidelines
- **Colors**: Use custom primary color palette (indigo/blue theme)
- **Dark Mode**: Always include `dark:` variants for all styling
- **Backgrounds**: 
  - Light: `bg-white`, `bg-gray-50`
  - Dark: `bg-gray-900`, `bg-gray-800`
- **Text Colors**:
  - Light: `text-gray-900`, `text-gray-700`, `text-gray-600`
  - Dark: `dark:text-white`, `dark:text-gray-300`, `dark:text-gray-400`
- **Primary Colors**: `text-primary-600` / `dark:text-primary-400`

## Code Standards

### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript with proper interfaces
- Define interfaces for all props and data structures
- Use React.FC for functional components
- Prefer type inference where possible

### React Patterns
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries where needed
- Use React.memo for performance optimization when necessary
- Keep components pure and predictable

### Animation Guidelines
- Use Framer Motion for all animations
- Implement staggered animations with delays (0.1s increments)
- Use `AnimatedSection` wrapper for consistent entrance animations
- Keep animations subtle and professional

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach using Tailwind breakpoints
- Test on: `sm:` (640px), `md:` (768px), `lg:` (1024px), `xl:` (1280px)
- Ensure touch-friendly interfaces on mobile
- Optimize images and content for different screen sizes

## Component Development Rules

### Button Component
- Support variants: primary, secondary, outline
- Support sizes: sm, md, lg
- Handle both Link (react-router) and external href
- Include proper dark mode styling
- Add focus states and accessibility

### Layout Component
- Fixed header with scroll detection
- Mobile hamburger menu
- Dark mode toggle with localStorage persistence
- Social links in fixed position
- Footer with copyright

### Page Components
- Use consistent page structure with container and padding
- Implement proper SEO with page titles
- Include loading states where appropriate
- Handle error states gracefully

## Styling Conventions

### Class Organization
```tsx
// Order: layout -> spacing -> colors -> effects -> responsive
className="flex items-center justify-center px-4 py-2 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-900 dark:text-white rounded-lg shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-all md:px-6"
```

### Dark Mode Implementation
- Always pair light and dark variants
- Use semantic color names from Tailwind config
- Test both modes thoroughly
- Ensure proper contrast ratios

### Animation Patterns
```tsx
// Entrance animations
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 30 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.8 }}
>

// Staggered list animations
<AnimatedSection delay={index * 0.1}>
```

## Performance Guidelines
- Lazy load images and heavy components
- Use React.memo for expensive re-renders
- Optimize bundle size with proper imports
- Implement proper loading states

## Accessibility Requirements
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance (WCAG AA)
- Focus management for modals and navigation

## Content Guidelines
- Professional tone for backend engineer audience
- Technical accuracy in project descriptions
- SEO-optimized content structure
- Proper alt texts for images

## Development Workflow
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Test dark mode on every change
- Verify responsive design on multiple breakpoints
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals

## Restrictions
- **NO additional UI libraries** (Material-UI, Chakra, etc.)
- **NO icon libraries** other than Lucide React
- **NO CSS frameworks** other than Tailwind CSS
- **NO state management libraries** unless absolutely necessary
- Keep dependencies minimal and focused

## File Naming
- Use PascalCase for components: `AnimatedSection.tsx`
- Use camelCase for utilities and hooks: `useLocalStorage.ts`
- Use kebab-case for assets: `hero-background.jpg`

## Temporary Files & Exclusions
- **NEVER commit** `.pr-*.md` files (PR description drafts)
- **NEVER commit** `.env` files (sensitive credentials)
- These are in `.gitignore` - keep them local only
- PR descriptions should be created via GitHub web interface

## Git Practices
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Test dark mode before committing
- Verify responsive design before pushing
- Keep commits focused and atomic

## Firebase & Analytics
- **Firestore Database**: Used for visitor analytics tracking
- **Environment Variables**: Stored in `.env` (not committed to git)
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Protected by password (`/analytics` route)
- **Admin Password**: Defined in `src/components/AdminAuth.tsx`
- **Tracked Data**: Page views, sessions, device type, browser, location, referrer
- **Security**: Update Firestore rules for production use

## Deployment Process
1. **Build**: `npm run build` - Creates optimized production build in `/dist`
2. **Deploy**: `npm run deploy` - Pushes `/dist` to `gh-pages` branch
3. **GitHub Pages**: Automatically deploys from `gh-pages` branch
4. **CNAME**: Custom domain (burakintisah.com) configured via `public/CNAME`
5. **SPA Routing**: `public/404.html` handles client-side routing on GitHub Pages

### Build Configuration (vite.config.ts)
- Code splitting: vendor, router, firebase, motion, icons
- Chunk size limit: 1000KB
- Optimized deps exclude: lucide-react

## Photo Management
- **Location**: `public/photos/` organized by category
- **Categories**: cherry/, japan/, korea/, trendyol/, usa/
- **Manifest**: `src/data/photoManifest.ts` - Manual photo registry
- **Format**: JPEG preferred, optimize before adding (<500KB)
- **Loading**: Uses photoLoader utility for efficient loading

## Environment Setup
Required `.env` variables:
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Component renders in both light and dark modes
- [ ] Responsive design works on all breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)
- [ ] Animations are smooth and purposeful
- [ ] Accessibility features work properly (ARIA, keyboard nav)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Performance is optimized (Lighthouse >95)
- [ ] Images are optimized and lazy loaded
- [ ] Firebase analytics tracking works
- [ ] Routing works on GitHub Pages (404.html)
- [ ] Dark mode toggle persists across pages
- [ ] External links open in new tab
- [ ] Mobile navigation works properly

## Performance Best Practices
- Optimize images before adding (TinyPNG, Squoosh)
- Use lazy loading for heavy components
- Monitor bundle size (check vite.config.ts chunks)
- Test Core Web Vitals
- Verify code splitting works correctly

## Important Notes
- **NO tests before asking**: User rule - never run build/tests without permission
- **Manual deployment**: Always manually deploy, no automatic CI/CD
- **Firebase costs**: Monitor Firestore usage, currently in test mode
- **Photo sizes**: Several images are 3-6MB, need optimization
- **Admin password**: Change default password in production

## Troubleshooting
- **404 on page refresh**: Check `public/404.html` script
- **Analytics not working**: Verify `.env` Firebase config
- **Images not loading**: Check public folder paths (no `/public` in URL)
- **Build fails**: Check TypeScript errors, verify dependencies
- **Dark mode not persisting**: Check localStorage implementation
- **Routing issues**: Verify basename in React Router (should be `/`)

Remember: Every component should be beautiful, functional, and production-ready. Focus on creating a cohesive, professional portfolio that showcases backend engineering expertise while maintaining excellent user experience.
